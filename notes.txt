instantaneous VM (periodtype must be halfhour) (interpolation must be True) (Calibration has no effect)

nan and infs just gives error 500

Could have "effectiveScaleFactor" instead returned as a float:
effectiveScaleFactor = float(defaultScaleFactor) if ScaleFactor == "" else float(scaleFactor)

cant fetch one by id?

/virtualmeters
